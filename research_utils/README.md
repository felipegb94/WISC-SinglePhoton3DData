# research_utils

Utility functions that I often use in research code (plotting, signal processing, io, etc)

* `plot_utils`: Useful functions for plotting and saving. Also contains ways to calculate error bars.
* `signal_processing_ops`: Usefule signal processing operations

## Adding as submodule

To add this as a submodule go to the repository and type the following commeands:

1. Add submodule: `git submodule add git@github.com:felipegb94/fgb_research_utils.git`
2. Commit submodule: `git commit -am "add research_utils submodule"`
3. Push: `git push origin master`

## Running the tests

The tests should either be run from the top-level folder (i.e., the folder where this file is), or `research_utils` should be a package that can be imported.
